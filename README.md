# Summer 2022 Bike App

Created by Kai Luedemann. Supervised by Professor Mario Nascimento

## Description:

This repository contains the code for an Android application used to crowdsource data about the 
quality of bicycle pathways. This app tracks accelerometer and location data while biking and 
(eventually) sends it to a web server to be aggregated.
